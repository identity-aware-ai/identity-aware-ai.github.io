# Travel Grants

Information about travel grants for the Identity-Aware AI 2025 workshop will be announced closer to the workshop date. We are committed to supporting participation from diverse communities and will make every effort to provide financial assistance to those who need it.

Please check back later for updates or contact us at [identity-aware-ai@googlegroups.com](mailto:identity-aware-ai@googlegroups.com) if you have any questions.

<!-- Good news! Thanks to the support from the National Science Foundation (NSF), HuggingFace and Google, there will be some funds available to support participants for travel, registration, and accommodation.

We already emailed participants who requested a travel scholarship with details.  -->
