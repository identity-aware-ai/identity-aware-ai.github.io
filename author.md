# Author Guidelines
The Identity-Aware AI 2025 workshop will adhere to the ECAI policies and guidelines for submission, review, and citation. Submissions should:

- __Be relevant__: Submissions to Identity-Aware AI 2025 should be relevant to the workshop themes and topics.
- __Be original__: The content of submissions to Identity-Aware AI 2025 (the ideas, the findings, the results and the words) should be original; that is, should not have been published (or be accepted for publication) in another refereed, archival form (such as a book, a journal, or a conference proceedings).

Authors may present preliminary versions of their work in other venues that are not refereed and/or not archival (e.g. course reports, theses, non-archival workshops, or on preprint servers such as arXiv.org). Authors should list all such previous presentations in the submission form.

## Double submission

Papers that have been or will be submitted to other venues must indicate this at submission time, and must be withdrawn from the other venues if accepted to Identity-Aware AI 2025. Authors of papers accepted for presentation at Identity-Aware AI 2025 must notify the program chairs by the camera-ready deadline as to whether the paper will be presented.

## Double blind review

Double blind review is a form of peer review in which the identities of authors are not provided to reviewers, and the identities of reviewers are not provided to authors. To facilitate double blind review, submissions must not identify authors or their affiliations. For example, self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 2021) ..." must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith previously showed (Smith, 2021) ...".

Any preliminary non-archival versions of submitted papers should be listed in the submission form but not in the review version of the paper.

## Accurately represent contributors

The author list for submissions should include all (and only) individuals who made substantial contributions to the work presented. Each author listed on a submission to Identity-Aware AI 2025 will be notified of submissions, revisions and the final decision. No changes to the order or composition of authorship may be made to submissions to Identity-Aware AI 2025 after the submission deadline.

## Data management

If a submission describes work with a data set previously released by an organization or group (e.g. the LDC, ELRA, Kaggle), the source of the data should be appropriately referenced.

If a submission describes work with "found" data (e.g. data sampled from social media or the web), the source(s) of the data should be appropriately referenced, the method for sampling the data should be described, and any necessary permissions to use and/or release the data should be documented. In addition, the submission should document institutional review of the work as appropriate.

## Human subjects

If a submission describes work involving human participants or personally identifiable information (including crowdsourced work), the submission should document institutional review of the work as well as informed consent and compensation procedures for participants, and anonymization procedures for the data.

## Referencing prior work

Submissions should accurately reference prior and related work, including code and data. If a piece of prior work appeared in multiple venues, the version that appeared in a refereed, archival venue should be referenced. If multiple versions of a piece of prior work exist, the one used by the authors should be referenced. Authors should not rely on automated citation indices to provide accurate references for prior and related work.

## Optional Supplementary Materials: Appendices, Software and Data

Papers should not refer, for further detail, to documents, code or data resources that are not available to the reviewers. Identity-Aware AI 2025 does encourage the submission of additional material that is relevant to the reviewers but not an integral part of the paper. There are two such types of material: appendices, which can be read, and non-readable supplementary materials, often data or code. Data and code should be submitted via the additional upload links on OpenReview. Appendices should be placed after your References section, starting on a new page, within the same document as your main paper. Additional material must adhere to the same anonymity guidelines as the main paper. Finally, your paper must be self-contained: it is optional for reviewers to look at the supplementary material.

## Ethics Policy

Authors are required to honor the ethical code set out in the ACM Code of Ethics. The consideration of the ethical impact of our research, use of data, and potential applications of our work has always been an important consideration, and as artificial intelligence is becoming more mainstream, these issues are increasingly pertinent. We ask that all authors read the code, and ensure that their work is conformant to this code. We reserve the right to reject papers on ethical grounds, where the authors are judged to have operated counter to the code of ethics, or have inadequately addressed legitimate ethical concerns with their work.

## Follow style and format guidelines

The style guidelines are specified under Submission Guidelines in the [Call for Papers](https://identity-aware-ai.github.io/cfp).  

## Paper Submission

Submission will be through OpenReview: [https://openreview.net](https://openreview.net). The submission link will be announced soon.
