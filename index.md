# Welcome to ACL SRW 2025
The ACL 2025 Student Research Workshop (SRW) will be held in conjunction with [ACL 2025](https://2025.aclweb.org/). It is a forum to bring together students investigating various areas of Computational Linguistics, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. The workshop provides an excellent opportunity for participants to present their work and to receive mentorship and valuable feedback from the international research community.

The workshop’s goal is to aid students at multiple stages of their education, including highschool, undergraduate, MSc/MA, junior and senior PhD students, in getting familiar with conducting and presenting their research.

!! -- We are recruiting mentors and reviewers!

Mentoring is a great way to meet new researchers interested in your research area, and to have a positive impact on the ACL community. See more info in [mentoring](https://acl2025-srw.github.io/mentoring) page. Please fill out this form if you are interested!

<!-- # Differences from Past SRWs -->
Similar to past SRWs, ACL 2025 SRW has two submission options--archival (appear in proceedings) and non-archival (only for presentation).
Authors can elect for both research papers and thesis proposals to be non-archival, in order to more explicitly encourage work in progress which can later be submitted to a future (archival) conference.
From a mentorship and reviewing standpoint, archival and nonarchival submissions are treated the same.

ACL 2025 SRW still has two different categories: thesis proposals and research papers.

See the [call for papers](cfp.md) for more details.
