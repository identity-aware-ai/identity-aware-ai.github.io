# Welcome to Identity-Aware AI 2025
The Identity-Aware AI 2025 workshop will be held in conjunction with [ECAI 2025](https://ecai2025.eu/). It is a forum to bring together researchers from diverse fields to understand how the identities of all stakeholders should be considered in future research in AI.

## Workshop Theme
**What makes each of us unique, and which ethical and technical challenges does this imply?**

Language (and thus the automatic processing of it) is about people and what they mean. However, current practice relies on the assumptions that the involved humans are all the same, and that if enough data (and compute power) is present, the resulting generalizations will be robust enough and represent the majority.

This approach often harms marginalized communities and ignores the notion of identity in models and systems. Our interdisciplinary workshop aims to raise the question of "what makes each of us unique?" to the AI community.

Contact us via email at [identity-aware-ai@googlegroups.com](mailto:identity-aware-ai@googlegroups.com) for any questions.
