# Mentoring

## Pre-submission Mentorship Program
The SRW offers students the opportunity to get advance feedback before submitting their work for review. The goal of the pre-submission mentorship program is to improve the quality of writing and presentation of the student's work, not to critique it. Participation is optional but encouraged. 
We especially encourage partipation from undergraduates, Masters students, and others who are new to research.

Note that pre-submission mentorship is not anonymous. However, you should still submit your paper in an anonymized format. We will check the formatting of each paper before we match mentors.

Participants will be matched with a mentor who will review and provide feedback to the student. This mentor will not be the same person who will review the final submission.
The feedback will be in the format of guidance and suggestions to improve the overall writing and communication of the paper; students are not required to make the changes suggested by the pre-submission mentor.

## !! Warning for Mentorship Program
* The SRW mentorship program aims to support **students**. It is not an appropriate venue for solicitation of any kind. Any further attempts to do so will result in a **permanent ban** from submission to the student research workshop.

* The corresponding author for the SRW mentorship program must be a **student**.

## Are you a professor, postdoc, or industry researcher?
Mentoring is a great way to meet new researchers interested in your research area, and to have a positive impact on the ACL community.
